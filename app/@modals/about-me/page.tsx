          Currently, I am a Senior Software Engineer at Posh, where I contribute
          to a high-paced startup environment, developing and maintaining a
          customer-facing web application powered by AI. My work focuses on
          enhancing user experience and system performance through the
          development of both frontend UI components and backend APIs.
        </P>
        <P>
          My career spans across several companies where I have consistently
          delivered high-quality code and collaborated with cross-functional
          teams to create scalable, sustainable, and accessible solutions. I
          have a strong background in developing AI-powered tools, optimizing
          web performance, and building comprehensive UI component libraries.

          Beyond my professional work, I enjoy exploring the complexities of
          software engineering and staying updated with the latest industry
          trends. When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me spending quality
          time with my family and my dog, Bernie 🐶.
